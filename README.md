# GodotProject
This is a simple Godot project that worked on developing a grid-based movement system before it would be used for more things down the line.
## Information
To open the files, you're going to need the Godot open source game design engine to plug the files into.
If you want to play the game that displays the project in process, you can download it, unload the .exe, and then run the .exe, it should run fine.
### Controls
Arrow keys to move up, left, right, and down.
